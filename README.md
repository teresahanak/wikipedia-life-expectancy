# wikipedia-life-expectancy
#### An End-to-end Supervised Machine Learning Project




## Introduction
*If a person makes the [Wikipedia Notable Deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2022) list, is there information there that can be used to model and predict that person's life span?*[<sup>[1]</sup>](#ref1)

The above problem question answers its predecessor: "What should I do for a portfolio project?"  In addition to allowing the demonstration of a wide range of data science [skills](#skills), I had three
 portfolio project criteria: (1) to scrape the data from the Web, (2) to perform extensive data cleaning (i.e., messy data), and (3) to solve a regression problem.  Enter Wikipedia Notable Deaths and we're off!


## Background
"[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers through open collaboration and a wiki-based editing system."[<sup>[2]</sup>](#ref2)  It contains a [List of deaths by year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_deaths_by_year) of notable individuals, with links to pages for each year, by month, from 1987 to present (2022).[<sup>[3]</sup>](#ref3)  Image 1 contains a sample from [Deaths in 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2022) for the month of January.[<sup>[4]</sup>](#ref3)
