## Introduction
*If a person makes the [Wikipedia Notable Deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2022) list,[<sup>1</sup>](#ref1) is there information there that can be used to model and predict that person's life span?*

In addition to demonstrating of a wide range of data science [skills](#skills), I had three portfolio project criteria: (1) to scrape the data from the Web, (2) to perform extensive data cleaning (i.e., messy data), and (3) to solve a regression problem.  Enter an exploration of life expectancy for Wikipedia notables, in the social sciences domain, and we're off and running\![<sup>2</sup>](#ref2)

<a id=back a></a>
## Background
"[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers through open collaboration and a wiki-based editing system."[<sup>3</sup>](#ref3)  The English-language version contains a [List of deaths by year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_deaths_by_year) of notable individuals, with links to pages for each year, by month, from 1987 to present.[<sup>4</sup>](#ref4)  The current page format is consistent as far back as January, 1994, with the following Wikipedia-defined fields for each entry:
> Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent country of citizenship (if applicable), reason for notability, cause of death (if known), and reference.[<sup>5</sup>](#ref5)  
> 
Year, month, and day of death are also readily available, as seen in the sample in [Image 1a](#img1a),[<sup>6</sup>](#ref6) from [Wikipedia Deaths in 2022, January](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_January_2022).[<sup>7</sup>](#ref7)


At the bottom of an indvidual's page (following the Name link), is a References section for that individual's page.  [Image 1b](#img1b)[<sup>8</sup>](#ref8) contains a sample from [Ramiz Abutalibov's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramiz_Abutalibov) page[<sup>9</sup>](#ref9).
The number of references is easily scraped and can represent the individual's notability, quantified.  With this proxy for notability added, the above elements provide a framework for collecting the data.

## Explore the Project
The links below access the Jupyter Notebooks that encompass the project.  Standalone contents and install/run instructions introduce each notebook, with a description of its corresponding version of the dataset.
- [Notebook 1: Data Collection](https://github.com/teresahanak/wikipedia-life-expectancy/blob/main/wp_life_expect_data_collect_thanak_2022_06_10.ipynb)
- [Notebooks 2 - 9: Data Cleaning](https://github.com/teresahanak/wikipedia-life-expectancy/blob/main/wp_life_expect_data_clean1_thanak_2022_06_13.ipynb)
- [Notebook 10: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/teresahanak/wikipedia-life-expectancy/blob/main/wp_life_expect_EDA_thanak_2022_09_30.ipynb)
- [Notebook 11: Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/teresahanak/wikipedia-life-expectancy/blob/main/wp_life_expect_data_preproc_thanak_2022_10_06.ipynb)
- [Notebook 12: Linear Regression -- Interpretation Emphasis](https://github.com/teresahanak/wikipedia-life-expectancy/blob/main/wp_life_expect_olsmodel_thanak_2022_10_9.ipynb)
- [Notebook 13: Modeling for Regression -- Prediction Emphasis](https://github.com/teresahanak/wikipedia-life-expectancy/blob/main/wp_life_expect_models_thanak_2022_10_14.ipynb)  

Web scraping steps are in Notebook 1, including details of the PyCharm project folder and links to its contents.

**Observations** appear throughout each notebook, documenting immediate context.  Exploratory Data Analysis, Linear Regression, and Modeling for Regression (Notebooks 10, 12, and 13) have additional **Summary**, **Insights**, or **Conclusion** sections at the end of their main content.

The link at the end of each notebook opens the next notebook.  [Return to README](https://github.com/teresahanak/wikipedia-life-expectancy#explore-the-project) links are available at the top and bottom of each notebook, to return to these instructions.  

[References](#refs) for the entire project are on this page.  Individual notebooks have self-contained footnotes.
