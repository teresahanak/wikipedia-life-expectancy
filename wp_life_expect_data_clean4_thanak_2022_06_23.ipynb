    "\n",
    "Also, we will abandon searching left to right as an individual may fit more than one category, and in no particular order.  For example, Ronald Reagan, is entered as \"American actor and politician\".  He is most known as the 40th president of The United States, so if we prioritized the first value, he would fit only into the category containing actor.  At the same time, it may have been his acting career that led to his political career.  Both arenas are relevant, so we will aim to capture all categories for an individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take the following approach:\n",
    "1. create and check a list of unique values in `info_2` using value_counts, in ascending order.\n",
    "2. using the pop() method, add each role to it's associated category's list, below, taking care to screen and clarify values that may have multiple meanings, and adding those clarified values to the lists as indicated.\n",
    "3. combine the lists for each category into one dictionary.\n",
    "4. Create a corresponding column for each category, initialized equal to 0.\n",
    "5. search for the values in the dictionary and change the category column to 1 if at least 1 match is found.\n",
    "6. Rather than importing our previous `other_species` list, we will start anew and include it in our search here."
