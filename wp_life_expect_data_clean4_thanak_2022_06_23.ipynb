For example, Ronald Reagan, is entered as \"American actor and politician\".  He is most known as the 40th president of The United States, so if we prioritized the first value, he would fit only into the category containing actor.  At the same time, it may have been his acting career that led to his political career.  Both arenas are relevant, so we will aim to capture all categories for an individual.  Later, when there are duplicate categories for an indivual, we can remove the redundant values.\n",

    "1. create and check a list of unique values in `info_2` that have a minimum number repeated, sufficient to create sets for each category, but not so exhaustive to be time prohibitive to manually enter.\n",
    "2. using the pop() method, add each role to it's associated category's set, below.\n",
    "3. combine the sets for each category into one dictionary.\n",

Likewise \"general manager\" in sports will come before \"general\" in law_enf_military_operator and \"military historian\" in academia_humanities will come before \"military\" in \"law_enf_military_operator\".\n",
